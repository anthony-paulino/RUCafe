Café Ordering App:
This project is an Android café ordering application developed as part of the coursework for CS213 Software Methedology at Rutgers University. The app allows users to browse various café items (e.g., donuts and coffee), place orders, and manage their selections. 
It demonstrates object-oriented programming (OOP) principles such as inheritance, polymorphism, and dynamic binding, while also leveraging Android components like RecyclerView, AlertDialog, Spinner, Toast, and ListView for a smooth user experience.

Features:
Menu Items: A list of at least 12 different donut options, each with an associated image, is displayed using RecyclerView.
Order Processing: Users can select items, and the app dynamically updates selections and subtotals based on input.
Multiple Screens: The app uses two Android Activities for navigation between the menu and order summary.
Singleton Design Pattern: A Singleton Java class is implemented to manage global data across different activities, ensuring data consistency.
Toast and AlertDialog: Interactive elements like Toast messages and AlertDialog are used for user notifications and confirmations.
Spinner and ListView: A Spinner and ListView are utilized for additional UI interactions within the app.
